          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>UCann is a concept app I designed and researched as part of a group project. We were tasked to create a
            piece of digital media that solves a problem that effects students on campus.</p>
        </article>
    </section>
    <h2 class="text-center">My Process</h2>

        <h2>1. Discover</h2>
        <h2>2. Define</h2>
        <h2>Finding our Problem</h2>
        <p>We narrowed down the topic of our problem to be adjusting to campus, however we needed to figure out what
          part of adjusting to campus was difficult. We started out by interviewing students with different
          backgrounds to hear their opinion on the transition of coming to school.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>“It’s definitely been an adjustment but I think I got used to it pretty quickly.”</h3>
        <p>- In State Senior living off campus with roomates</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>“There's so much work so I feel like I dont have free time to myself”</h3>
        <p>- Out of State Freshman living on campus with a random roommate</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <p>Then, we conducted a survey which received 130 responses. This was to gauge the aspects of transitioning to
          school that gave students difficulty. The findings in this survey contradicted our initial assumption about
          students' difficulty getting adjusted to living on campus. Most students felt that on a scale of 1-5 they
          adjusted to living on their own at a 4. This data shocked us and caused us to pivot our problem statement.

    <section>
      <p>The most difficult aspect of transitioning for students was time management (43.3%) and mental health
        (32.3%).
        We realized that these two issues were connected: If a user was able to improve their time management, then
        their mental health would improve. This led us to develop our problem statement
      </p>
      <article>
        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>How might we use a mobile app to improve time management skills for undergraduate students at UConn?
        </p>
      </article>
      <p>After focusing in our our problem, I reached out to an expert in the field of time management, Leo Lachut.
        Leo
        is the Director of the Academic Achievement Center.</p>
      <article>
        <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
        <h3>There are 3 facets of Time Management: Attention Management, Life Management, and Self Regulation</h3>
        <p>Attention Management is how we can focus on a task without getting distracted. Life Management are the
          unexpected events that derail your plans. Self Regulation is our internal motivation to complete a task.
          Students track their assignments hour by hour rather than in a big picture sense</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>There is a correlation between mental health and time management</h3>
        <p>People suffer from Sunday Scary, which means they have a lot of anxiety for the impending week on sunday.
          Most
          heart attacks occur on Sundays.With poor mental health comes low motivation.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>There are study techniques to help with motivation</h3>
        <p>Techniques such as the Pomodoro method, which breaks up the amount of work done at a time helps with
          students
          motivation. After COVID, students are experiencing social engagement fatigue, and are relearning study
          skills
          and social skills</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>3) Develop</h2>
        <h2>Ideation Stage</h2>
        <p>We used Miro, a web application to help us with our ideation stage. We worked together to come up with 3
          different digital media tools to solve our problem</p>
      </article>

        <article>
          <h2>Top 3 Ideas</h2>
          <h3>1) YouTube Channel</h3>
          <p>The Youtube Channel would feature videos about time management that would be filmed by UConn Students</p>
          <h3>2) Group Chat</h3>
          <p>This Group Chat would act as an accountability partner and would include students that would allow
            students
            to set goals</p>
          <h3>3) Calendar App</h3>
          <p>This app would allow you to input your personal and academic assignments which would be featured in a
            calendar. Users would get notifications to hold them accountable for getting their assignments in on
            time.

        <h2>Full Transparency</h2>
        <p>This is where my first iteration of the project ended. I did no wireframes, no comprehensive information
          architecture. I took a template off the internet and made it my own with fonts because this was my first time
          using Adobe XD. At this point, I wrapped up my project, handed it in for grading and forgot about it for 2
          years.
        </p>
        <h2>Reigniting the Flame</h2>
        <p>Between my freshman and junior year I had a lot of growth. I worked on some new projects, learned more about user research, and fine tuned my skills in UI. When the opportunity came to rework this project, I jumped at the chance to showcase my skills.
        </p>
        <h2>Looking Back
</h2>
        <p>These designs were the first iterations of the app that I created 2 years ago. I looked at this app and
          identified some pain points that I wanted to address with my new design. After working on this group
          project, I moved on and completed other projects. However, I wasn’t satisfied with how the project turned
          out and knew that I wanted to revisit it in the future. The first thing I wanted to do was assess some
          pain points of the app to give me a starting point to work off of.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>Pain Points</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no bottom navigation to easily switch between screens
          </li>
          <li>The home screen buttons don’t come across as buttons
          </li>
          <li>There is equal weighting between all the buttons on the first page, whereas the app should be more
            focused in keeping track of assignments rather than mental health resources
          </li>
          <li>There is no consistency in border radius in the cards on the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is little consistency in font weights, and the hierarchy is not well established
          </li>
        </ul>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>New and Improved Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>How might we create a mobile app that helps students manage their time by incentivizing completing assignments, which in turn improves their mental health?
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>Reanalyzing the Data  </h2>
        <p>My biggest issue with my first iteration was that it gave equal weight to time management and mental health resources. The survey showed that 42.3% found time management to be the most difficult part of transitioning as opposed to 32.3% for mental health. The bottom line was that I wanted this app to be time management forward with mental health functions that could be toggled.
        </p>
      </article>
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <p>I decided to look at competitors in the field to gain a better perspective on what other companies were
        doing right and wrong. The two apps I decided to research are Evernote and Any.do. I downloaded these apps
        onto my phone and took notes based on my experience. I found that these apps have features that are
        blocked behind a paywall and lack any recognition of mental health struggles.

        <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
        <p>I organized the app to be focused on the Task Input and Reward aspect because based on the survey students
          felt that they struggled with Time Management the most. I decided to make the Pomodoro Timer and the Mental
          Health Resources a widget that can be disabled because not all students struggle with their mental health.

      <h2>User Personas</h2>
      <p>After analyzing the issues with the app, I decided to construct user personas to better understand our target
        demographic and their pain points. In my user personas, I wanted to represent a diverse set of students,
        because historically commuter students and older students are overlooked

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>In my wireframes I wanted to establish the general layout of the app and the design of the cards that I use
          throughout the app. Overall I stayed true to this design, however there are some small tweaks I made including
          rounding the cards and changing the icons in the bottom navigation that I made along the way.

        <h2>4. Deliver</h2>
        <h2>Iteration</h2>
        <p>At first, I wanted to go for a single color app with variations of the opacity of the main color to create my
          color palette, however this left my app feeling a little flat, so I decided to change up the color scheme to
          replace the purple-blue to a more standard blue. At this point I added a red accent color, but it drew too
          much attention to the reward bar, so I decided to add a dark blue which corresponds with UConn’s branding. By
          the end of my designs I implemented a rounded border radius on the body of the app to add more visual interest
          to the app and I chose to fill in the bottom navigation icon to make it more clear for the user which screen
          they are on
        </p>

          <h2 class="next">Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p>This experience definitely taught me the value in conducting user research. In my first designs I
            created, I jumped straight into the design phase after conducting interviews, which made the app less
            usable. Once I started to implement user research, especially the user personas which allowed me to better
            understand my users goals, then my wireframes and designs improved. I think this app is a testament to the
            growth I have made as a UX designer, as I now have a new appreciation for the empathize stage of the
            design process.
