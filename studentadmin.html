          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>UConn Student Admin is an Oracle Student Information System that is a platform for students to view Academic information, financial information, and personal information. Students enroll in classes, pay their fee bill, apply for graduation, and more using the interface. Student Admin is a website I and many other students encounter on a weekly basis, I’ve been involved in many conversations about how much the user interface (for lack of better terms) sucks. For my Senior Design Project, I decided to conduct a case study on the application to see how it can be improved. </p>
        </article>
      <article>
        <h2>Current State </h2>
        <p>As my advisor once said when I was interviewing him for this project, “The homepage of student admin is a wasted opportunity.” The site gives equal weight to all the different functionalities. Additionally, the navigation is clunky, resulting in having to go in and out of pages without proper back buttons. In my experience, I never used some of the tiles, however, I wanted to validate my hypothesis. I decided to create a survey to gauge the student body's opinion on the application </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h2>Survey Results n=129 </h2>
        <p>I then created a survey to gain insight into the most and least used aspects of Student Admin as well as students pain points. I sent this email out through the UConn daily newsletter, which gained some traction allowing for an even distribution of years and majors.  </p>

        <p>At this point, I was working under the assumption that the Student Body were the subject matter experts, and relying on their input solely would suffice for my research. However, one response from the survey piqued my interest, and made me reconsider my opinion... </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h3>“So, I work at the One Stop Student Services Office... The people who are impacted the most by the oddities of student admin are our international, first gen, and transfer students.” </h3>
      </article>
      <p>After reading this response, I realized that solely relying on the student body was only going to give me half of the story, and rather, I should look to the professionals who interact with the student body as well </p>
      <p>
        I immediately contacted the person who left this response on my survey. I scheduled an interview and started to figure out what exactly I wanted to get out of our conversation. 
      </p>
      <p>The main points I expanded on during my interview questioning were: </p>
      <article>
      <h3>1) Her role as a Student Administrative Assistant at One Stop </h3>
      <p>I wanted to have a deeper understanding of how frequently she interacts with the students and on what topics. For example, is she assigned to questions only from Freshman? This would impact how I interpret the insights  </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>2) The onboarding process for an employee for One Stop </h3>
      <p>I wanted insight into how she became a subject matter expert on Student Admin, in my experience, there was no onboarding process inside of Student Admin when I first used the platform.  </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>3) Her comments about the disproportionate impact on First-Gen and minority students </h3>
      <p>I wanted examples of the disproportionate impact on First-Gen and minority students. What are the oddities? Is it a technology issue? a language barrier? Inexperience? </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>4) Suggestions she has for the platform </h3>
      <p>Seeing that she was on the frontlines of Student Admin, I wanted to hear her insights on the pitfalls of student admin based on her experiences with guiding students through their issues </p>
    </article>
    <article>
      <h3>Interview Key takeaways</h3>
      <p>She works at the front desk taking walk ins and phone related to classes. Most of her questions are related to finding transcripts, enrolling in classes, utilizing the planner, and applying for graduation. The questions range from being about where to find information to what information means </p>
    <p>There is no onboarding process for students in student admin, she was trained 3 years ago by shadowing someone which was very helpful. Knowledge based articles exist, but they live outside the platform </p>
  <p>The majority of the cases she deals with are from First Gen and Minority student. For example, some first gen students aren’t familiar with the Monday Wednesday Friday schedule because no one in their life has had that schedule. For international students whose first language isn’t English, words such as “Add”, “Drop”, and “Swap” can get confusing. The shopping cart language is another pain point for International Students, as they sometimes think that they are already enrolled when it is in the shopping cart </p>  
<p>The tiling on the homepage can be confusing, there are many places for you to add classes, with some enrolling you and some not enrolling you. The academic planner can be problematic, especially if you are creating an advisement report, because planned courses are counted as already taken </p>

<h3>How might we replicate this onboarding process inside the portal so students can become Subject Matter Experts like Carlie to improve the user experience? </h3>
</article>
<article>
  <p>After this conversation, I scheduled an interview with Mike Ormsby, the Director of One Stop Student Services at UConn. I wanted to widen my perspective on Student Information Systems by learning about the general field itself. The main points I wanted to touch on were </p>
<article>
  <h3>1) What does your role entail and where have you worked in the past? </h3>
<p>I was curious as to what level he deals with the interactions with students, what portions of student admin does he have the most insights on </p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>2)What other Student Information Systems are out there and how do they compare?</h3>
<p>I wanted to leverage his potential knowledge and opinions on other Student Information Systems so I could research them myself after to draw inspiration for my wireframes </p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>3)How could student admin improve? </h3>
<p>Given all of his experience with Student Information Systems, I felt that he would have good insight into how student admin could improve for the student body </p>
</article>
<article>
<h3>Main takeaways </h3>
<p>Mike joined UConn as the Director of One Stop Services over a year ago, he oversees Undergraduate Admission, Registration, and Financial Aid. UConn utilizes Oracle PeopleSoft for Student Admin, but prior to UConn he used Banner when he worked at the University of Hartford </p>
<p>The main two softwares he is familiar with is Peoplesoft and Banner, while both systems are archaic, he prefers Banner because Banner allows you to see a variety of information on one screen such as the GPA, credits, and schedule. Banner is used at smaller institutions so there is more customization, therefore, a better user interface </p>
<p>The main issue with student admin is not where the information lives, but what it means. For example, students can access their financial aid package, but they struggle to understand what it means </p>
<article>
<h3>How might we clarify the language in Student Admin so the functions of each feature and their potential repercussions are clear? </h3>
