    <h2><strong>Hello!</strong></h2>
        <p>
          Hello everyone! My name is Melina Sandel, and I am UX Designer at the UConn DX Group and Greenhouse Studios where I implement accessible design solutions. I am currently a Junior at the University of Connecticut where I major in Web and Interactive Media Design!

<br>
<br>
I’ve had a passion for Art and Design ever since my mom entered me into my first Photography competition in second grade. I started to use photoshop when I was in third grade, and I’ve been captivated by the Adobe Suite ever since (although I am an avid Figma user). By the time high school was wrapping up, I felt like I was at a crossroads: I always enjoyed design, and considered going into graphic design, however I never felt like I fit into the fine arts box. After some soul searching my mom suggested to me UX Design. I began researching the field and realized that the career path aligned with all of my passions and values. I’ve always had an inquisitive spirit, so I am really drawn into the User Research aspect of UX Design because it allows me to really understand people's wants and needs. It fulfills my innate curiosity.

          <br>
          <br>
          I truly value collaboration, and at Greenhouse Studios, I work with a wide array of professionals of different ages, skill sets, and backgrounds, and as a person these experiences have contributed immensely to my personal growth. I love building relationships with my coworkers on a personal level.
          <br>
          <br>
          Accessibility is incredibly important to my work as well. At the DX Group, I am currently working on an interactive web map that plots cemeteries in mental institutions. My extensive user research sparked my curiosity for accessibility standards. The potential of accessible design is limitless. Accessibility is always at the forefront of my projects as inclusivity is vital for meeting the needs of all users. I act as both a UX Designer and Front-End Developer, so I am very familiar with working on projects starting from ideation all the way to implementation. I have extensive experience with HTML, CSS & Javascript and Javascript Frameworks like Svelte and Vue. My experience in coding has made me a great problem solver, and allows me to work well with Front-End Developers on projects. This project taught me the importance of user research, and being able to empathize with my users, and it has become my favorite user research project to date!
          <br>
          <br>
          When I’m not researching and designing, I’m probably reading. My genre of choice is celebrity memoirs! I am incredibly (some may say too) invested in celebrity drama and gossip, so that's almost exclusively the only types of books I read. However, recently I’ve been trying to diversify my book choices so I am currently reading The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. 
          <br>
          <br>
          My eclectic background in UX Design and experience in Front-End Development makes me a valuable team player that can successfully collaborate with a diverse team. If you have any questions, or would like to collaborate on a project, don’t hesitate to contact me!
